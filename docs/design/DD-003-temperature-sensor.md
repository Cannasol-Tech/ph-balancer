### pH Compensation Implementation

**Temperature Coefficient Calculation:**
```cpp

float ph_compensated = ph_raw + (temp_coefficient * (temp_celsius - 25.0));
```

**ESP32 Implementation Example:**
```cpp
#include <OneWire.h>
#include <DallasTemperature.h>

class TemperatureCompensatedpH {
private:
    OneWire oneWire;
    DallasTemperature tempSensor;
    float referenceTemp = 25.0; // °C
    float tempCoefficient = -0.00457; // pH/°C
    
public:
    bool initialize(int tempPin) {
        oneWire = OneWire(tempPin);
        tempSensor.setOneWire(&oneWire);
        tempSensor.begin();
        return tempSensor.getDeviceCount() > 0;
    }
    
    float readTemperature() {
        tempSensor.requestTemperatures();
        return tempSensor.getTempCByIndex(0);
    }
    
    float compensatepH(float rawpH, float temperature) {
        return rawpH + (tempCoefficient * (temperature - referenceTemp));
    }
};
```

**Installation Considerations:**
