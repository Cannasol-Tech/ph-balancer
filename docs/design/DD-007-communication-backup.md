    CommPriority current_priority = ESP_NOW_PRIMARY;
    
    unsigned long last_espnow_success = 0;
    unsigned long last_wifi_success = 0;
    const unsigned long COMM_FAILOVER_TIMEOUT = 60000; // 1 minute
    
    bool espnow_enabled = true;
    bool wifi_ap_enabled = false;
    
public:
    void updateCommunication() {
        bool espnow_status = attemptESPNOWCommunication();
        bool wifi_status = attemptWiFiCommunication();
        
        // Priority logic: ESP-NOW first, WiFi backup
        if (espnow_status) {
            current_priority = ESP_NOW_PRIMARY;
            last_espnow_success = millis();
            if (wifi_ap_enabled) stopWiFiAP(); // Save power

            current_priority = WIFI_SECONDARY;
            last_wifi_success = millis();
        } else {
            current_priority = OFFLINE;
            if (!wifi_ap_enabled) startWiFiAP(); // Enable for local access
        }
        
        updateStatusLEDs();
    }
    
    bool sendData(SensorData data) {
        switch (current_priority) {
            case ESP_NOW_PRIMARY:
                return sendViaESPNOW(data);
            case WIFI_SECONDARY:
                return sendViaWiFi(data);
            case OFFLINE:
                storeDataForLaterTransmission(data);
                return false;
        }
    }
    
private:
    void startWiFiAP() {
        WiFi.mode(WIFI_AP);
        WiFi.softAP("pH-Balancer-" + getDeviceID());
        wifi_ap_enabled = true;
    }
};
```

**Data Buffering for Offline Operation:**
```cpp
class OfflineDataBuffer {
private:
    struct DataPoint {
        unsigned long timestamp;
        float ph_value;
        float temperature;
        uint8_t pump_status;
        uint8_t alarm_flags;
    };
    
    static const int BUFFER_SIZE = 288; // 24 hours at 5-minute intervals
    DataPoint buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
    int buffer_head = 0;
    int buffer_count = 0;
    
public:
    void storeData(float ph, float temp, uint8_t pumps, uint8_t alarms) {
        buffer[buffer_head] = {millis(), ph, temp, pumps, alarms};
        buffer_head = (buffer_head + 1) % BUFFER_SIZE;
        if (buffer_count < BUFFER_SIZE) buffer_count++;
    }
    
    bool transmitBufferedData() {
        // Transmit stored data when communication restored
        // Return true when buffer successfully transmitted
    }
};
```

This dual wireless communication approach provides reliable communication for pool/spa applications while maintaining cost-effectiveness and installation simplicity. The system gracefully handles communication outages and automatically recovers when connectivity is restored.
