    const int LOW_LEVEL_THRESHOLD = 20; // 20% remaining
    
    bool acid_level_ok = true;
    bool base_level_ok = true;
    unsigned long last_level_check = 0;
    const unsigned long LEVEL_CHECK_INTERVAL = 60000; // 1 minute

    void updateLevelStatus() {
        if (millis() - last_level_check > LEVEL_CHECK_INTERVAL) {
            acid_level_ok = digitalRead(ACID_LEVEL_PIN) == HIGH;
            base_level_ok = digitalRead(BASE_LEVEL_PIN) == HIGH;
            
            if (!acid_level_ok) {
                triggerAlert("ACID_LOW", "Acid chemical level low - refill required");
            }
            
            if (!base_level_ok) {
                triggerAlert("BASE_LOW", "Base chemical level low - refill required");

        return acid_level_ok && base_level_ok;
    }
    
    float estimateChemicalRemaining(bool is_acid) {
        // Estimate remaining chemical based on usage tracking
        // This requires tracking pump runtime and flow rates
        return is_acid ? getAcidRemaining() : getBaseRemaining();
    }
};
```

**Safety Implementation:**

**Secondary Containment Design:**
- Chemical-resistant HDPE drip trays under each container
- Capacity: 110% of chemical container volume (2.75 gallons minimum)

- Mounting system prevents container displacement

**Refilling Procedures:**
```
Safe Chemical Refilling Protocol:

Pre-Refill Checks:
1. Stop all pump operations
2. Put on appropriate PPE (gloves, safety glasses)
3. Verify container identity (acid vs. base)
4. Check container condition for cracks or damage

Refilling Process:
1. Remove container from mounting system
2. Transport to safe refilling area
3. Use funnel to prevent spills
4. Fill to maximum level mark (not overfill)
5. Secure cap and check for leaks
6. Clean exterior of any spills
7. Return container to mounting system
8. Test level sensor operation
9. Resume normal operation

Post-Refill Documentation:
1. Record refill date and quantity
2. Update chemical inventory tracking
3. Schedule next refill reminder
4. Report any issues or observations
```
