```cpp
class HybridDataLogger {
private:
    struct DataPoint {
        unsigned long timestamp;
        float ph_value;
        float temperature;
        uint8_t pump_status;
        uint8_t system_status;
    };
    
    File dataFile;
    const char* current_filename = "/data/current.csv";
    unsigned long last_log_time = 0;
    unsigned long log_interval = 60000; // 1 minute default
    
    // Cloud sync variables
    unsigned long last_cloud_sync = 0;
    const unsigned long cloud_sync_interval = 86400000; // Daily
    
public:
    void logData(float ph, float temp, uint8_t pumps, uint8_t status) {
        if (millis() - last_log_time >= log_interval) {
            // Log to SD card
            writeToSDCard(ph, temp, pumps, status);
            
            // Check if cloud sync needed
            if (millis() - last_cloud_sync >= cloud_sync_interval) {
                scheduleCloudSync();
            }
            
            last_log_time = millis();
        }
    }
    
private:
    void writeToSDCard(float ph, float temp, uint8_t pumps, uint8_t status) {
        dataFile = SD.open(current_filename, FILE_APPEND);
        if (dataFile) {
            dataFile.printf("%lu,%.2f,%.1f,%d,%d\n", 
                millis(), ph, temp, pumps, status);
            dataFile.close();
        }
    }
    
    void scheduleCloudSync() {
        // Compress and upload daily summary to cloud
        createDailySummary();
        uploadToCloud();
        last_cloud_sync = millis();
    }
};
```

**Cloud Data Compression:**
- Store hourly averages instead of minute-by-minute data
- Upload alarms and significant events immediately
- Compress normal operation data into daily summaries
- Reduce cloud storage costs by 90-95%

**Privacy and Security:**
- User data encrypted during transmission and storage
- Optional anonymous analytics for product improvement
- Clear privacy policy and user control over data sharing
- Compliance with applicable data protection regulations

This hybrid approach provides the reliability of local storage with the convenience of cloud access, making it suitable for both residential and commercial pool installations while managing costs effectively.
